# nextArtifacts

nextArtifacts is an open-source project that enables users to generate small applications using any Large Language Model (LLM) API compatible with the OpenAI format. This project is inspired by and modified from [llamacoder](https://github.com/Nutlope/llamacoder), which uses Llama 3 405B & Together.ai.

## Features

- Compatible with any LLM API that follows the OpenAI format
- Test the React coding capabilities of various language models

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20 or higher)
- pnpm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/etrobot/nextArtifacts
   cd nextArtifacts
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   pnpm dev
   ```

4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

### Configuration

1. Fill in the required fields:
   - LLM API Key
   - Model name
   - LLM base URL

2. Start testing the React coding abilities of your chosen model!

## How It Works

nextArtifacts allows you to input prompts and generate small applications using the power of large language models. By leveraging APIs compatible with the OpenAI format, you can experiment with various models to create React components and applications.
