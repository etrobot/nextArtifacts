# nextArtifacts

nextArtifacts is an open-source project that enables users to generate small applications using any Large Language Model (LLM) API compatible with the OpenAI format. This project is inspired by and modified from [llamacoder](https://github.com/Nutlope/llamacoder), which uses Llama 3 405B & Together.ai.
